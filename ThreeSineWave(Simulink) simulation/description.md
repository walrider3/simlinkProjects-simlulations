# Three Sine Wave simulations on Simulink.
So, I created 3 sine waves with different frequencies and amplitudes and showed 3 different outputs possible.
# 1: Simple scope output
For the first case, I connected all three sine waves to one scope and viewed the output.

# 2: Simple scope output
For the second case, I connected all three sine waves to one mux block and viewed the output.

# 3: Simple scope output
For the third case, I connected all three sine waves to one sum block and viewed the output.
